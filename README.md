Description:
The Personal Diary Application is a simple and intuitive tool for keeping track of personal diary entries. It allows users to:

Add new diary entries: Users can input a title and content for their diary entries.
View diary entries: Users can view the full content of any selected diary entry.
Delete diary entries: Users can remove unwanted or outdated entries from the diary.
This application uses the Tkinter library for a graphical user interface (GUI) and SQLite for storing the diary entries in a local database. The application features a modern and clean UI with buttons for adding, viewing, and deleting entries, and a listbox to display the diary titles. The database ensures that diary entries are stored persistently.

Instructions:
Install Python:

Make sure that Python 3.x is installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Python website.
Download the Code:

Copy the provided Python code into a text editor or IDE, such as VS Code, PyCharm, or IDLE, and save it as personal_diary.py.
Running the Application:

Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux).
Navigate to the directory where you saved personal_diary.py using the cd command.
Type the following command and press Enter to run the application:
